    Nand2Tetris:<br/>Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
</h1>

## Overview
The best way to understand how a computer works is to build one myself! Includes all projects completed as part of the Nand2Tetris course: https://www.nand2tetris.org/. Each step represents another layer of abstraction, utilising functionality from previous steps.

## 1. Boolean Logic
All of the most primitive logic gates.

## 2. Boolean Arithmetic
Construction of the ALU.

## 3. Memory
Construction of RAM and counter.

## 4. Machine Language
Multiplication program written in assembly language.<br/>
I/O-handling program written in assembly language.

## 5. Computer Architecture
Full memory chip<br/>
...

## 6. Assembler
